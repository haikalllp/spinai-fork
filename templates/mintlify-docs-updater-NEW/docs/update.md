# Updating to Vercel AI SDK for OpenAI

This document outlines the migration from the direct OpenAI API to the Vercel AI SDK implementation in the docs-updater-gpt project.

## Overview

We've updated the codebase to use Vercel's AI SDK for OpenAI integration, which provides better compatibility, features, and a more modern approach for working with AI models.

### Changes Made

1. Installed required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai
   ```

2. Created a centralized OpenAI client configuration for consistent settings across the codebase.
3. Updated all AI-related functionality in action files to use the new SDK.
4. Improved error handling for AI responses.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Centralized Client Configuration

Created a new utility file at `src/utils/ai.ts` to provide a single source of truth for OpenAI configuration:

```typescript
import { createOpenAI } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

/**
 * Centralized OpenAI client configuration
 * Used for all AI operations in the codebase to ensure consistent settings
 */
export const ai = createOpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  compatibility: 'strict',
  // Default to gpt-4-turbo for best results in documentation generation
  // Any organization or custom settings can be added here
});
```

This approach ensures:
- Consistent configuration across the codebase
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Proper settings for the official OpenAI API

### 2. Updated Import Statements

Changed import statements from:
```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";
```

To:
```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { ai } from "../utils/ai";
```

### 3. Model Instantiation Changes

Changed how models are instantiated and used:

**Before:**
```typescript
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
  messages: [...],
  temperature: 0.1,
  response_format: { type: "json_object" },
});
const result = response.choices[0]?.message?.content;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { text: responseContent } = await generateText({
  model: ai("gpt-4-turbo-preview"),
  temperature: 0.1,
  messages: [...],
});
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling

Added robust error handling for JSON responses:

```typescript
let analysis;
try {
  analysis = JSON.parse(responseContent || "{}");
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Failed to parse JSON response");
  analysis = {
    // Default values
  };
}
```

## Files Updated

The following files were updated:

1. `src/actions/analyzeCodeChanges.ts`
   - Updated OpenAI imports
   - Modified model instantiation
   - Enhanced JSON parsing with error handling

2. `src/actions/analyzeDocStructure.ts` 
   - Updated to use centralized client
   - Improved error handling for JSON responses

3. `src/actions/generateContent.ts`
   - Updated OpenAI implementation
   - Refined text generation approach

4. `src/actions/planDocUpdates.ts`
   - Updated AI client usage
   - Enhanced error handling for plan parsing

## Benefits of the Update

1. **Modern API**: Using the latest Vercel AI SDK provides access to the most recent features and improvements.

2. **Better Compatibility**: The AI SDK has better compatibility with different runtime environments.

3. **Simplified Usage**: The SDK provides more intuitive APIs that handle many edge cases automatically.

4. **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration makes future updates easier.

5. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling provides more resilience in the application.

## Usage Example

The updated code follows this pattern for AI-powered functionality:

```typescript
// Import the centralized client
import { ai } from "../utils/ai";
import { generateText } from "ai";

// Use the client to generate text
const { text: responseContent } = await generateText({
  model: ai("gpt-4-turbo-preview"),
  temperature: 0.3,
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Generate some content for me.",
    },
  ],
});

// Process the response
console.log(responseContent);
```

## Future Considerations

- Consider exploring other features of the Vercel AI SDK such as streaming responses
- Look into other model providers supported by the AI SDK for potential alternatives
- Periodically check for updates to the AI SDK to stay current with new features and improvements
